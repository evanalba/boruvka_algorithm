# Borůvka's algorithm
This is a project I made for a course I took back in university called CSCI 411: Advanced Algorithms and Complexity. This project consisted of us investigating an algorithm that interests us. The algorithm I chose was called Borůvka's algorithm, which is a greedy algorithm that can find a minimum spanning tree in a graph. Also, for this project in this course, we needed to come up with a report, the implementation of our algorithm with test cases included, and a presentation.

(Note: The implementation of Borůvka's algorithm uses the **C++11** standard.)
